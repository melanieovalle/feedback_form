# Feedback Form
Implemented a form to collect user feedback in the given 'FeedbackForm' component. The component utilizes React's useState hook to manage form data state, including the user's name, email, and feedback.
The 'handleChange' function updates the form data state as the user inputs information into the form fields. Upon form submission, the 'handleSubmit' function prevents the default form submission behavior, displays a confirmation dialog with the user's details, clears the form fields, and shows a thank you message upon confirmation.

The form includes input fields for the user's name and email, and a text area for providing feedback.
